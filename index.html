        <h2 id="whatHead">What is Avengers Doomsday?</h2>
        <p class="what"> <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers:_Doomsday"><img src="./images/avengersdoomsdaylogo.png"></a> <br> Avengers Doomsday is an upcoming movie produced by Marvel Studioes and Disney. <br> The movie will follow the world of the MCU facing the newest villain in the Multiverse Saga, Dr. Doom. <br> The movie is set for release on May 1st, 2026. <br> Fun fact, the movie was originally called Kang Dynasty. <br> However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Majors#2023_assault">due to Jonathan Majors' lawsuits, </a> the movie was retooled to be about Dr. Doom. </p>

        <h2 id="whyIHead">Why Am I Excited for Avengers Doomsday?</h2>
        <p class="whyI"> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/arts/robert-downey-dr-doom-marvel.html"><img class="wrap" src="./images/rdjreveal.png"></a> I have been a huge fan of the MCU for the longest time. <br> Sure, it's had its ups and downs recently, but with recent success like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_%26_Wolverine">Deadpool & Wolverine,</a> the MCU seems to be having a comeback. <br> So to see that they are not only bringing one of the best Marvel villains to the MCU, but also bringing in Robert Downey Jr. to play Dr. Doom? <br> I'm very intrested to see how this will go. <br> Especially since many MCU heroes have already been confirmed to appear.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="whyUHead">Why Should YOU Be Excited for Avengers Doomsday?</h2>
       <p class="whyU">Avengers Doomsday will be the first in a two part event. <br> This movie will most likely end with Dr. Doom creating Battleworld, a place where all multiverses will collide in Avengers Secret Wars! <br> Not to forget that the movies will be directed by the great Russo Brothers! <br> The Russo Brothers are the directors behind Infinity War and Endgame, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Endgame">with the latter being the second heightest grossing movie of all time!</a> <br> Needless to say, this movie is in good hands. </p>
